**e**nd-**o**f-**d**ay a.k.a. **e**xercise-**o**r-**d**ie

An attempt to gamify exercise with **real** game mechanics.

## The game
At the end of each day, BUGs will spawn and kill you(r game character) if you're not fit enough...

## What is this for
This was the example project that Chek has used in his Mobile App Dev classes in SIT. It was constructed purely for the purposes of demonstrating various app dev techniques so the legitimacy of the features should be treated with a grain of salt.

Also the app architecture and code coherency across several places may be poor due to having to structure the code to be conducive for conducting a class.

There are also some examples of how you can use GitHub issues to help manage your Scrum processes. You can view them in the [project board](https://github.com/ict2105-csc2007/eod/projects/1).

## WARNING
For the `core` module, it should be treated as legacy code that hasn't been updated for ages and have no proper documentation.
